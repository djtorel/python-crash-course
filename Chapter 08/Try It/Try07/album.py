# Write a function called make_album() that builds a dictionary
# describing a music album. The function should take in an artist name
# and an album title, and it should return a dictionary containing these
# two pieces of information. Use the function to make three dictionaries
# representing different albums. Print each return value to show that
# the dictionaries are storing the album information correctly.

# Add an optional parameter to make_album() that allows you to store the
# number of tracks on an album. If the calling line includes a value for
# the number of tracks, add that value to the albumâ€™s dictionary. Make
# at least one new function call that includes the number of tracks on
# an album.
