# Start with your program from Exercise 9-1 (page 166). Add an attribute
# called number_served with a default value of 0. Create an instance
# called restaurant from this class. Print the number of customers the
# restaurant has served, and then change this value and print it again.

# Add a method called set_number_served() that lets you set the number
# of customers that have been served. Call this method with a new number
# and print the value again.

# Add a method called increment_number_served() that lets you increment
# the number of customers whoâ€™ve been served. Call this method with any
# number you like that could represent how many customers were served
# in, say, a day of business.
